This project is a health check tool for Temporal services. It provides functionality to check the health of the
FrontendService, HistoryService, and MatchingService of a Temporal server.

## Usage

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/saga420/temopral-healthchecker.git
```

- Build the project:

```bash
cd temporal-healthchecker
go build
```

- Create a config.json file following the structure described in the Configuration section.

- Run the healthchecker:

```bash
./temporal-healthchecker --config=path_to_your_config.json
```

## Configuration

The configuration is done via a config.json file. Here is an example of the file:

```json 
{
  "FrontendService": {
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "Address": "127.0.0.1:7233",
    "TimeOut": 10
  },
  "HistoryService": {
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "Address": "127.0.0.1:7234",
    "TimeOut": 10
  },
  "MatchingService": {
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "Address": "127.0.0.1:7235",
    "TimeOut": 10
  }
}
```

Results of the health check will be logged to the console.

## Documentation

This tool provides two main checks: BasicCheck and FullCheck.

If any of these checks fail, the program will log the errors and exit with a status code of

1. If all checks pass, the program logs that all services are healthy and exits with a status code of 0.

The BasicCheck checks if the configured services are reachable, while the FullCheck performs a deeper health check (
implementation depends on your actual requirements).

The tool is also designed to be compatible with Docker and Consul health check requirements.
